### Where I'm From

I was born in San Diego, California, and I lived there continuously with my family until arriving in Minnesota to attend Macalester. I grew up very close to the ocean, and my parents were seafood importers/exporters, so I must admit I miss the Pacific quite a bit.

### What I'm Studying and Career Goals

Upon arriving at Macalester I was intent on being a math and music double major, and thus far I am on track to complete it. This being said, I have found myself much more active as a musician and in the music department than in the math department. I play upright bass, electric bass, viola da gamba and to a much lesser extent trumpet and piano. I have performed bass duties with: 
* The Macalester Jazz Band 
* The Macalester Early Music Ensemble
* Word On the Street
* Replicas 
* Numerous other combos

I am hoping to go to graduate school for music and music education in order to secure a job teaching music(specifically Jazz) in some capacity.
